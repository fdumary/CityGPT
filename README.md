# CityGPT

305 Hackathon 2025, Track #2 - Digital City Platforms & Apps

## Description:
CityGPT is the virtual web assistant for your city's needs. The chat answers questions regarding city services, such as bus schedules, tax deadlines, permits, and trash pickup.  Many cities and local municipalities have websites that are hard to navigate for the average resident or citizen. These websites have confusing layouts, which makes them slow and not mobile-friendly. CityGPT eliminates these issues by providing instant, accurate answers, guiding you to the right services.
